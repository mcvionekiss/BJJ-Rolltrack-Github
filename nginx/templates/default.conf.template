# This file is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer used directly.
# The Nginx configuration is now split into separate files:
#
# 1. http_only.template - Used when HTTPS is disabled or certificates are not available
# 2. http_redirect.template - Used for HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect when HTTPS is enabled
# 3. https_server_block.template - Used for HTTPS server when HTTPS is enabled
# 4. common_settings.inc - Common settings included by both HTTP and HTTPS configurations
#
# See the docker-entrypoint.sh script for how these files are processed.
